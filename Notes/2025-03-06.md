# Development Summary - March 6, 2025

## Project Overview

Today we created a Magic: The Gathering card search application using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS. The application allows users to search for Magic cards by name, view search results, and explore card details including artwork.

## Key Components Developed

### 1. Initial Setup
- Created a Vue.js project with TypeScript support
- Configured Tailwind CSS for styling
- Set up the project structure and basic components

### 2. Search Functionality
- Implemented a search bar component for querying the Scryfall API
- Created a service to handle API calls with proper error handling
- Added a "Get Random Card" feature

### 3. Card Display
- Developed a component to display card details and artwork
- Added support for double-faced cards
- Implemented error handling for image loading

### 4. Search Results List
- Created a component to display multiple search results
- Added filtering capability to refine results
- Implemented sorting with multiple options (name, rarity, set)
- Added keyboard navigation for accessibility
- Fixed scrolling behavior to ensure selected cards are visible

### 5. Documentation
- Created a comprehensive README with project description
- Added a ToDo list for tracking planned enhancements
- Set up this Notes directory for development documentation

## Technical Highlights

### Vue.js Features Used
- Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax
- Computed properties for reactive data processing
- Component props and emits for parent-child communication
- Lifecycle hooks (onMounted, onBeforeUnmount)
- Template refs for DOM manipulation

### Tailwind CSS Implementation
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Custom component styling
- Utility classes for layout and spacing
- Hover and focus states for interactive elements

### TypeScript Integration
- Type-safe component props
- Interface definitions for API responses
- Type annotations for functions and variables

### Git Workflow
- Created feature branches for development
- Made focused commits with descriptive messages
- Merged completed features back to main
- Maintained a clean repository structure

## API Integration

The application integrates with the Scryfall API to fetch Magic: The Gathering card data:
- `/cards/named` endpoint for searching cards by name
- `/cards/search` endpoint for retrieving multiple matching cards
- `/cards/random` endpoint for getting random cards

## Next Steps

Based on our ToDo list, potential next features include:
1. Card History - Track previously viewed cards
2. Advanced Search Filters - Filter by color, type, etc.
3. Favorites System - Save favorite cards
4. Gallery View - Display multiple cards in a grid
5. Animation Enhancements - Add transitions and effects

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Image Loading Issues
**Solution:** Implemented better error handling and fallbacks for card images, added debugging information, and fixed CORS issues.

### Challenge: Keyboard Navigation Scrolling
**Solution:** Enhanced the scrolling logic to check element visibility in the viewport and improved timing with setTimeout.

### Challenge: Tailwind CSS Configuration
**Solution:** Updated the configuration to work with the latest version of Tailwind CSS and fixed import paths.

## Conclusion

Today's development session resulted in a functional Magic: The Gathering card search application with a clean, responsive UI and robust search capabilities. The application demonstrates modern web development practices using Vue.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
