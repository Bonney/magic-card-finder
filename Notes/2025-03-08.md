# Development Notes - March 8, 2025

## Changes Made

### Fixed TypeScript Issues in Filter System
- Resolved type compatibility between `FilterState` and `SearchFilters`:
  - Made `FilterState` extend `SearchFilters`
  - Changed `set` property type from `string | null` to `string | undefined`
  - Added proper null/undefined checks for CMC filters
- Successfully built project with all TypeScript errors resolved

### Added Advanced Filtering System
- Created new `FilterPanel.vue` component with:
  - Color filters (White, Blue, Black, Red, Green, Colorless)
  - Card type filters (Creature, Instant, Sorcery, etc.)
  - Mana value (CMC) range filter
  - Card text search filter
  - Reset filters button
- Enhanced `ScryfallService.ts` with advanced search capabilities:
  - Added `SearchFilters` interface
  - Modified `searchCards` method to support filter parameters
  - Implemented Scryfall syntax query building
- Updated `SearchResultsView.vue`:
  - Added filter panel to search results page
  - Implemented responsive layout (sidebar on desktop, top panel on mobile)
  - Added filter state management
  - Integrated with existing search functionality

### Removed Drawing Tool Feature
- Removed the `CardDrawingOverlay.vue` component
- Cleaned up `CardDisplay.vue`:
  - Removed drawing mode toggle button
  - Removed drawing overlay integration
  - Restored original card hover effects
- Feature moved to Future Features list for later reimplementation with improved functionality

### Image Loading Improvements
- Modified image loading priority to prefer normal size first:
  ```typescript
  imageUrl = card.image_uris.normal || 
            card.image_uris.large || 
            card.image_uris.png;
  ```
- Added cache-busting parameters to prevent CORS issues:
  ```typescript
  imageUrl = `${imageUrl}?${Date.now()}`;
  ```
- Added `referrerpolicy="no-referrer"` to image elements
- Maintained `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute for proper CORS handling

## Technical Details

### New Components
- `FilterPanel.vue`:
  ```typescript
  interface FilterState {
    colors: string[];
    types: string[];
    set: string | null;
    cmc: {
      min: number | null;
      max: number | null;
    };
    text: string;
  }
  ```
  - Real-time filter updates using computed properties
  - Event-based communication with parent component
  - Tailwind CSS styling with hover and active states

### Removed Components
- `CardDrawingOverlay.vue` - Drawing functionality component
- Drawing-related state in `CardDisplay.vue`:
  - `cardWidth` and `cardHeight` refs
  - `isDrawingMode` state
  - Drawing mode toggle button
  - Canvas overlay elements
