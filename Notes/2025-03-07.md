# Development Notes - March 7, 2025

## Today's Changes

### Multi-Page Architecture Implementation
- Converted the application from a single-page to a multi-page architecture using Vue Router
- Added proper URL routing and browser history support
- Created three main view components:
  - `HomeView`: Main search page
  - `SearchResultsView`: Search results with filtering
  - `CardDetailsView`: Individual card details

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed card details page not loading due to `getCard` method not being static
- Added proper error handling and validation in `ScryfallService.getCard`
- Improved navigation between search results and card details
- Added search context preservation when viewing card details
- Removed unused `from` parameter in card navigation while maintaining search query context
- Fixed search results list sizing and alignment
- Fixed high-quality card image loading by prioritizing large/normal images over art crops

### Layout Improvements
- Fixed search results list sizing and alignment
- Removed fixed width constraints that were causing left alignment
- Ensured proper full-width layout while maintaining padding

### GitHub Pages Deployment Setup
- Added GitHub Pages configuration to Vite
- Created GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment
- Updated router configuration for GitHub Pages compatibility
- Added proper base URL configuration
- Configured proper build and deployment steps

### TypeScript Improvements
- Enhanced type safety across all components
- Added proper error handling interfaces and types
- Improved API response type handling in ScryfallService:
  - Added `ScryfallError` interface
  - Created reusable `handleResponse<T>` method
  - Added `validateCardImageData` helper
  - Improved error handling with type guards
- Fixed component prop types and null checks:
  - Updated PropType imports to be type-only
  - Fixed string | null vs string | undefined type mismatches
  - Added proper type guards for optional properties
  - Improved error state management in components

## Technical Details

### Router Implementation
- Installed `vue-router@4`
- Set up router configuration with proper props passing
- Implemented route parameters for card IDs and search queries
- Added navigation guards and proper back button handling

### Component Updates
1. `SearchResultsView`:
   - Added query parameter handling
   - Improved navigation to card details with search context
   - Maintained search state for back navigation
   - Simplified card navigation by removing unused parameters

2. `CardDetailsView`:
   - Added proper card loading by ID
   - Implemented contextual back navigation
   - Added loading and error states

3. `ScryfallService`:
   - Made `getCard` method static to match other methods
   - Added proper error handling and validation
   - Improved error messages for better debugging
   - Added type-safe API response handling
   - Implemented proper error interfaces

4. `NavigationBar`:
   - Added error state management
   - Improved type safety for route query parameters
   - Added proper error display UI
   - Added loading state handling

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding keyboard navigation from search box to results list
2. Add loading animations between route transitions
3. Implement search history feature
4. Add advanced search filters
5. Consider adding a favorites system
6. Monitor GitHub Pages deployment and performance

## Notes
- The multi-page architecture significantly improves user experience
- URLs are now shareable and bookmarkable
- Browser navigation works as expected
- Layout is more responsive and makes better use of space
- TypeScript implementation is now more robust and type-safe
- Application is ready for production deployment on GitHub Pages
