# Development Notes - March 7, 2025

## Today's Changes

### Multi-Page Architecture Implementation
- Converted the application from a single-page to a multi-page architecture using Vue Router
- Added proper URL routing and browser history support
- Created three main view components:
  - `HomeView`: Main search page
  - `SearchResultsView`: Search results with filtering
  - `CardDetailsView`: Individual card details

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed card details page not loading due to `getCard` method not being static
- Added proper error handling and validation in `ScryfallService.getCard`
- Improved navigation between search results and card details
- Added search context preservation when viewing card details

### Layout Improvements
- Fixed search results list sizing and alignment
- Removed fixed width constraints that were causing left alignment
- Ensured proper full-width layout while maintaining padding
